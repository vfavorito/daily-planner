# Hourly Schedule

## Work Day Planner

### Overview:
In this repository I created a Work Day Planner.  The planner has hourly time blocks from 9AM - 5PM.  These time blocks allow you to click in them and add any plans you have for that hour!  After typing out your plans in a time block you can click the save button to store those plans.  The Time blocks are also color coded based on the time of day it is!  If an hour time block has already passed for the day it will display gray.  If a time block is the present hour of the day it will dislay red, and if the time block is in the future it will display green.  This was primarily accomplished using Jquery, Bootstrap, and moment.js.  

## How it works!
